1. Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze the historical stock price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) and gain insights by calculating and visualizing key financial metrics, such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. These metrics help in identifying trends in stock performance over time.

2. Technologies Used:
Python: Primary language for the analysis.
yfinance: Used to fetch historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
pandas: For data manipulation and calculation of moving averages.
matplotlib: For visualizing the stock prices and moving averages.
3. Project Workflow:
Step 1: Data Collection:

Using the yfinance library to download historical stock data for AAPL from January 2020 to January 2023.
Data includes Open, High, Low, Close prices, as well as Volume.
Step 2: Data Preprocessing:

Load the stock data into a pandas DataFrame.
Preview the data by displaying the first few rows to understand its structure.
Step 3: Compute Financial Metrics:

Calculate the 50-day and 200-day moving averages of the stock’s closing prices using the rolling function in pandas. These averages help to smooth the stock price fluctuations and identify trends over different time periods.
Step 4: Visualization:

Create a line plot using matplotlib to visualize the closing price along with the 50-day and 200-day moving averages.
Label the axes, add a legend, and set the title to describe the chart effectively.
Display the plot to gain a visual understanding of the stock’s performance.
4. Possible Extensions:
Bollinger Bands: You could add a feature to compute and visualize Bollinger Bands to assess the stock’s volatility.
Volume Analysis: Add an analysis of trading volumes to correlate them with price movements.
Comparison with Other Stocks: Extend the project to analyze and compare multiple stocks to identify the best performers in the same period.
5. Conclusion:
This project offers a structured approach to conducting basic financial analysis on stock market data, using moving averages as a method to identify trends and support decision-making.
